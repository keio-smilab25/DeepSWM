## 📖 Abstract

  <br>
  Accurate, reliable solar flare prediction is crucial for mitigating potential disruptions to critical infrastructure, while predicting solar flares remains a significant challenge. Existing methods based on heuristic physical features often lack representation learning from solar images. On the other hand, end-to-end learning approaches struggle to model long-range temporal dependencies in solar images.

In this study, we propose **Deep Space Weather Model (Deep SWM)**, which is based on multiple deep state space models for handling both ten-channel solar images and long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. Deep SWM also features a **sparse masked autoencoder**, a novel pretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve crucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information. Furthermore, we built **FlareBench**, a new public benchmark for solar flare prediction covering a full **11-year solar activity cycle**, to validate our method. Our method **outperformed baseline methods** and even **human expert performance** on standard metrics in terms of performance and reliability.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Solar Spatial Encoder (SSE)**: Captures spatio-temporal features by selectively weighting image channels and modeling dependencies across space and time.
- **Long-range Temporal SSM (LT-SSM)**: Extends deep state-space models to capture temporal patterns exceeding the solar rotation period.
- **Sparse MAE**: A tailored pretraining strategy for solar images that preserves critical but sparse regions (like sunspots) using a novel two-phase masking approach.
- **FlareBench Dataset**: A new public benchmark covering a complete 11-year solar cycle for robust and unbiased evaluation.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Installation

Clone the repository and set up the environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/DeepSWM.git
cd DeepSWM

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

## 📊 Data Preparation

The full **FlareBench** dataset (approximately 1.26 TB, `tar` + `zstd` compressed) is available for academic use at the following URL:

```
https://pub-4f7db9ce770f41a091c81b96648d9afd.r2.dev/flarebench_dataset.tar.zst
```

The archive contains the raw `aia/`, `hmi/`, and `xrs/` directories. After downloading, extract it with

```bash
tar --zstd -xf flarebench_dataset.tar.zst
```

Then build the hourly HDF5 datasets with `ml/src/data/create_datasets.py`. The script expects `aia/` and `hmi/` to be located directly under `--data_root`, while `xrs/` is expected to reside in the parent directory of `--data_root` (see the path construction in the script). Please arrange the extracted directories accordingly before running the script.

The dataset is provided **for academic use only**. Please do not redistribute it.

## 🚀 Pre-training

Run the pre-training process to learn representations from the magnetogram images:

```bash
cd ml
python pretrain.py --input_dir ../flarebench_dataset/all_data_hours \
                  --output_dir ../flarebench_dataset/all_features \
                  --mode train \
                  --data_root ../flarebench_dataset
```

## 🔍 Feature Extraction

Extract intermediate features from the pre-trained model:

```bash
cd ml
python pretrain.py --input_dir ../flarebench_dataset/all_data_hours \
                  --output_dir ../flarebench_dataset/all_features \
                  --mode inference_all \
                  --data_root ../flarebench_dataset
```

Organize the extracted features by sample:

```bash
cd ml
python src/features/create_history_features.py
```

## 🎯 Training

Train the model using the extracted features:

```bash
cd ml
python main.py --params params/main/params.yaml \
              --imbalance \
              --fold 3 \
              --data_root ../flarebench_dataset \
              --cuda_device 0

```
